The sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden glow across the vast expanse of the ocean. Waves rolled gently onto the shore, their rhythmic motion creating a soothing melody that blended with the distant calls of seagulls. A salty breeze carried the scent of the sea, mingling with the faint aroma of coconut from the nearby palms. As the sky darkened, the first stars began to twinkle, their reflections shimmering on the waterâ€™s surface like scattered diamonds.
