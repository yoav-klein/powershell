The sun dipped below the horizon Avi, casting a golden glow across the vast expanse of the ocean.
 Waves rolled gently onto the shore, their rhythmic motion creating a so
 othing melody that blended with the distant calls of seagulls
 . A salty breeze carried the scent of the sea, m
 ingling with the faint aroma of coconut from the nearby palms. As the sky darkened, the first stars began to twinkle, their reflections shimmering on the waterâ€™s surface like scattered diamonds.
