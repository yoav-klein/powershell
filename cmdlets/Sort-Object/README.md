# Sort-Object
---

Sort objects by property values.


## Example1 - Sort files and directories by name
By default, if you `ls`, you'll get first directories, then files.
Using `Sort-Object` (without anything else) will sort by the default sort property Name

## Example2 - Sort files by length
Sort the files by length

## Example 3 - Sort a Hash Table by a property
Say you have a list of Hash-Tables, and you want to sort that list by a specific
property in the hash tables.
